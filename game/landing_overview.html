									<p>Learners ages 15+ will deepen their capacity for empathy and self-reflection (Fullerton, 2019) after playing <i>To Exist in Pieces</i>, a single-player narrative exploration game that allows players to take the perspective of an adolescent and their family as the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine forces them to abandon their country and resettle in Canada, leaving their father and home behind. </p>
									<h3>Target audience</h3>
									<p>Made for a 15+ audience, centring on the experience of a teenager in a global conflict to explore the curricular goals of this age group (BC’s Curriculum, n.d.)</p>
									<h3>Intended use</h3>
									<p>Learning and skill development goals:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>empathy and self-reflection skills: achieved by immersion in personal narrative perspective (Trost, 2009)</li>
									<li>social justice challenges: understanding the impact of refugee status on similarly-aged peers to target audience (Hodes, 2023)</li>

												<h3>The characters</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The Protagonist: Young and naïve, the protagonist is a teenager who is fairly disconnected from the conflicts outside of their comfortable family life and school routine. They spend a lot of their time on the Internet and on their phone, and thus use their phone to record their journey.</p>
											<p>Olena (NPC): The protagonist’s kind mother, Olena is an educated woman who is content taking care of the family and maintaining a peaceful home. However, as the narrative unfolds, Olena is forced to become the breadwinner for herself and the protagonist, learning to stand strong despite the terrifying situation in which she finds herself.</p>
											<p>Ivan (NPC): The protagonist’s father, Ivan is a stoic, hardworking man with a good job, easily able to support his family. He worries for his parents who are in their later years and unable to relocate, so when the decision to stay behind while his family flees comes to be, he does not hesitate, despite wanting to stay with his child and wife more than anything.</p>

												<h3>The story</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The narrative unfolds through an exploration of the 6 of the most impactful memories of a Ukrainian teenager living with their parents in Kyiv, Ukraine, in March 2022, when the horrifying Russian invasion truly begins (American Journal of International Law, 2022). Although they are confident that their family shall be all right despite international tensions, they are quickly forced to flee from their home country with their mother; their father decides to stay behind with the other men of fleeing families and care for their grandparents as the conflict escalates (Hodes, 2023). Fleeing by car, they are eventually able to take a plane from Italy to Canada with refugee status; but being a teenager, the overwhelming trauma of the situation leaves them hopeless. They are suddenly forced to learn a new language, integrate into a foreign society, and worry endlessly for their father and home country on the other side of the world (Osokina et. al, 2023). However, as they grow close with their mother and reflect on the sacrifice their father has made to stay behind, they learn to see the light in their situation and promise to work hard in this new land, beginning their healing journey.</p>

												<h3>Gameplay research and EDIDA frameworks</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The creation of this game was rooted deeply within gameplay research. The choice to create a narrative-driven game to provide the player the opportunity to explore the challenging political climate of the current Ukrainian and Russian conflict was very intentionally made, as “story integrated with play can create powerful results” (Fullerton, 2018, p. 46), especially when utilized “for engaging people’s emotions” (Fullerton, 2018, p. 354). In a situation as complex as this one, we took it upon ourselves to explore a single narrative of a single character’s journey in the third person, as it “allows for a sense of empathy to develop with our player character” (Fullerton, 2018, p. 262). This story is one rife with difficult emotion, and so to capture those different stages of growth experienced by the protagonist throughout their journey, we decided to give consequences for each decision made in-game by the player to reflect the concepts of “stress” and “resilience” which are key in the game’s themes of personal growth through tragedy. Each level provides different interactions and objectives not only to reflect this growth, but to also avoid “stagnation [through] repetition” (Fullerton, 2018, p. 373). This interactivity was keenly chosen to support player engagement through “negotiating an immersive environment rather than […] stand-alone task completion” (De Castell & Jenson, 2003, p. 655). Providing this opportunity for empathy-building to our target audience is also best scaffolded through narrative-driven content, as a game, “at its best and most powerful, is engaging seriously, with effort, commitment, and determination” which “affords pleasure, excitement, immersion, and playfulness” (De Castell & Jenson, 2003, p. 659).</p>

</p>This game was made with equity, diversity, inclusion, decolonization, and antiracism in mind regarding every aspect of its formal and dramatic elements to ensure accessibility to as many potential players as possible while still being engaging. In <i>To Exist in Pieces</i>, players are able to choose their player character’s name, gender, pronouns, and appearance; through this, the player is able to create representation for themselves within the narrative with whom they can connect, unlike many narrative-driven games which limit player agency regarding the protagonist. Historically, many Western games centre upon heterosexual cisgender white men, pushing aside the narratives of other marginalized communities (Feminist Frequency, 2017) or placing minorities into strict character roles based on stereotypes (Peckham, 2020). The openness of the protagonist’s intersecting identities allow for freedom of expression for the player while also respecting the serious nature of the narrative.</p>
<p>Thus, through choices about narrative and gameplay, game design can further several elements of Kersch and Lesley’s ethical framework of media literacy pedagogy (2019), by incorporating multiliteracies through digital technologies, examining multiple viewpoints and non-dominant perspectives, and modelling processes of testimonies and healing.</p>
