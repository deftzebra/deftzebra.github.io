									<h2>The Team</h2>
									<h4>Methodology</h4>
									<p>We each focused on a different area to contribute to overall game design. However, as is common with smaller teams (Fullerton, 2018), we took on a variety of tasks to complete milestones and, ultimately, the game itself:</p>
									<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<p><b>Anne</b> - Leader, Narrative</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Communicated vision for the game. Wrote scripts for events, as well as the overall story for the game.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Firas</b> - Design</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Assessed platforms, designed game levels, created and tested prototypes, and other tasks that contributed to play experience.</li></ul>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<p><b>Mariya</b> - Audiovisual, Research</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Created and managed graphics, sounds and other game assets that contributed to the look and feel of the game.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Melissa</b> - Project Manager</p>
									<ul>
									<li>Similar to Fullertonâ€™s producer (2018), created a plan for game delivery. Monitored tasks, resource allocation, and schedules.</li>
									</ul>
									</div>
									</div>
									<h2>New Learning</h2>
									<h3>Challenges</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>RPGMaker expiry date prevented us from designing as many playable levels as we wished. While the short time frame pushed us to finish early, the rush did impact Firas' workload and the team's stress levels.</li>
									<li>RPGMaker's framework restricted some of the game's concepts.</li>
									<li>RPGMaker did not allow co-editing, which slowed the process and required more off-game coordination.</li>
									<li>The limited maps and items in RPGMaker restricted the depiction of the narrative.</li>
									<li>Our project management platform was not sufficiently user-friendly, which led to collaboration across multiple platforms: WhatsApp, Slack, Notion, and Google Drive.</li>
									</ul>
									<H3>Opportunities</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>Consider both the concept and the limitations of a platform before initializing the design process.</li>
									<li>Use a platform that allows co-editing, so all team members can participate in the design.</li>
									<li>Condensing a very heavy topic into a few tableaus without the connective tissue &#8212; while also thinking about how to  put the narrative in place within the framework we have.</li>
									<li>Use a simpler, more intuitive platform for collaboration, making it easier to keep all information in one place.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Takeaways</h3>
									<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<p><b>Anne</b></p>
									<ul>
									<li>Narrative delivery is highly dependent on the platform and gameplay modes
									</ul>
									<p><b>Firas</b></p>
									<ul>
									<li>Many twists can be made to make the game design closer to the concept on paper
									</ul>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
									<p><b>Mariya</b></p>
									<ul>
									<li>Play more video games: when you play, you learn about how other games are structured and what features they have, which helps in the creation of your own video game.</li>
									</ul>
									<p><b>Melissa</b></p>
									<ul>
									<li>Focus on process over product: I stepped back on certain product management methodologies, but they could have helps us mitigate the impact of scarce resources and potential risks, such as the RPGMaker expiry date.</li>
									</ul>
									</div>
									</div>
									<h3>What would we do differently?</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>Find or design items, spores, and maps to better reflect the game's characters or scenes.</li>
									<li>With more time, we could have conducted exclusive interviews with Ukrainian refugees, gathering testimonies that would add more authenticity to the game, the promoting more empathy.</li>
									<li>Transforming this game into a VR game, with 3D models that represent actual people, would give a realistic feel to the game and prompt the player to employ more empathy.</li>
									</ul>
